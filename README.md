An automatic payroll process helps you comply with legal and tax
requirements and simplifies the process of paying your employees. Many employers outsource the payroll function to an outside vendor or use payroll system software instead of relying on manual processes. <br />
<br />
# Wages:<br />
A payroll system calculates the amount you owe your employees based on factors such as the time they worked, their hourly wages or salaries, and whether they took vacation or holiday time during the pay period. The system adjusts gross pay by calculating and subtracting taxes and other withholding amounts. On payday, the
system provides your employees with paper checks or payroll deposits and a summary of the information you used to calculate their 
gross and net wages.
<br /><br />
# Taxes and Withholding:<br />
The system adjusts employees pay based on the withholding status they provided on their IRS W-4 forms, and generates a W-2 form at the end of the year.<br />
A payroll processing system can also calculate the amount of payroll tax you owe and automate your payments to taxing authorities. It processes other payroll deductions
such as wage garnishments and voluntary deductions.
